<h1 align="center">Discord Bot</h1>

Discord bot that use the Twitch and Reddit APIs, the goal of this bot is to provide a chatbot for servers, an auto moderator and notify about Twitch channels that are live streaming. The bot gets its answers from Reddit comments. By using [NLP.js](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js), the bot can guess the language (currently English and French) and react to the user's message by a 'üëç' for positivity and 'üëé' for negativity. User can add/remove Twitch channels to/from the notification list, also retrieve them and display those who are live streaming
